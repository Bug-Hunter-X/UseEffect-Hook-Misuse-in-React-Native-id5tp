In the corrected version (`bugSolution.js`), the `count` state is updated using the `setCount` function provided by the `useState` hook. This ensures that React Native correctly tracks the state changes and re-renders the component accordingly.  The code also includes a dependency array in `useEffect` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
